### MediaPlayer Class Overview

The MediaPlayer class is designed to manage a collection of songs and handle playlist operations. It includes functionality to:

- **Add a Song to the Playlist:** Add a song to the playlist if the song is already registered.
- **Display the Playlist:** View all the songs currently in the playlist.
- **Remove a Song from the Playlist:** Remove a specific song from the playlist.
- **Play the Playlist:** Simulate playing the songs in the playlist.

The class manages two key components:
1. **Registered Songs List:** A list of all songs available in the system.
2. **Playlist:** A list of songs selected for playback.

### Execution Instructions

To set up and run the MediaPlayer class, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Files:**
   - Create a header file `MediaPlayer.h` to define the MediaPlayer class and its methods.
   - Create an implementation file `MediaPlayer.cpp` to implement the methods defined in the header file.
   - Create a `main.cpp` file to test the functionality of the MediaPlayer class.

2. **Compile the Program:**
   - Use a C++ compiler to compile your files. If you are using `g++`, the command will be:
     ```sh
     g++ -o MediaPlayer main.cpp MediaPlayer.cpp
     ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program using:
     ```sh
     ./MediaPlayer
     ```

4. **Test the Functionality:**
   - Verify that you can add songs to the playlist, display the playlist, remove songs from the playlist, and play the playlist as described in the class functionality.
